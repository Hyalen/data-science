 * --This little introduction is just a trustful reminder for those (including myself) that are
 * not 100% familiar with neural networks. Based on the book "How To Make Your Own Neural Network"--
 *
 * 1) What is a perceptron?
 * A perceptron is the most basic form of an artificial neural network: a linear classifier
 *
 * 2) What will be tested in this code?
 * The following concepts and core ideas taken from the book will be tested:
 * - matrix of weights
 * - matrix of inputs
 * - threshold to trigger the output
 * - sigmoid function
